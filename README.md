# Data Cleaning and Integration
## Objective 
Take messy datasets and transform them into clean, structured data for analysis

## Tools
Python, Pandas, SQL, Jupyther Notebooks

## Steps
1. Find real-world datasets (e.g. weather data) with missing or inconsistent values 
2. Use Pandas in Python to handle missing data, normalize values (e.g. converting all dates into a standard format), and clean anomalies
3. Store and clean data in a SQL database, making sure the schema is designed to ensure data integrity
4. Write SQL queries to validate the data (e.g. checking for duplicates or outliers)
5. Create a Jupyter Notebook that explains the process step-by-step, with code, visualizations and narrative

## Skill Showcased
- Data preprocessing and transformation using Python libraries
- Database management using SQL, with a focus on data integration
- Writing clean, well-documented code in Jupyter for reproducibility
